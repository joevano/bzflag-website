INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Unpack the code into a new directory

2. Configure the database.

   Edit the config/database.yml file and change the 
   following fields to appropriate values:

   adapter : specified database engine - we use mysql.  See the Rails
             documentation for other database options.  There are
             lots.

   database: Configure the names of your 3 databases for the
             development, test, and production environments

   username: username with access to the database

   password: password for access to the database

   host    : hostname the database server is on

3. Create the databases

   mysql> create database bzflag_dev;
   mysql> create database bzflag_test;
   mysql> create database bzflag;

4. Edit the website configuration file to specify your host and email
   address for the site contact page

   Edit config/config.yml and change

   support_email: to your email contact address

   root_url : to the site running your website (ie localhost:3000, or
   		  my.host@domain.com) This is used by the bzflag
   		  global authorization system to pass the valid token
   		  back to your websiteso you can validate bzflag users.

   If you need different values for production or development you can
   override the common values in those sections of the file
