This project is maintained in a git repository at
git://git.norang.ca/bzflag-website.

This file describes basic project maintenance and is based on the git
project maintenance work flow.

There are four main integration branches as follows:

 - 'maint' is the latest stable release
 - 'master' is the development branch with new work for the
   upcoming release
 - 'next' contains stable topics for some future release
   (intentionally left out of the next release)
 - 'pu' is pending updates
   - experimental stuff that may be included or dumped or
      rewritten

maint, master, and next never rewind history.  It is safe to base your
development topics on any of these branches.  Topics should be based
on the oldest branch where they will be applied.  Bug fix topics for
maint should be anchored on maint so that merging into later branches
is easy. (maint merges topic, master merges maint, next merges master,
etc.)

Merging goes as follows:

 - maint is the oldest supported stable release
 - master into maint, maint advances and records a new release tag
 - master merges cooked topics ready for the next release
 - next merges cooked topics for a following release
 - pu merges experimental stuff and is normally rebased
   - this allows topics to be dropped, rewritten, or graduate to a
     branch that only merges to advance (master, maint, or next)

To keep things up to date:

 - maint merges maintenance topics (bug fixes)
 - master merges maint
 - next merges master
 - pu is rebased on next regularly

New topics are included in pu and reviewed before graduation to next
or master.
