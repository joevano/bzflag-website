# BZFlag Website TODO list

This is a free-format text file which works with Emacs org-mode
Headings start with one or more *'s in column 1, todo keyword (TODO/DONE), and headline text
DONE items can be removed to keep the list short.  DONE items are available in the git repository.

* TODO Create documentation information about working on the project
  1. Git branches
     - maint (doesn't exist until v1.0)
     - master
     - next
     - pu (pending updates)

     This is basically based on the git project maintenance workflow.

     Normally:
       - 'maint' is the old (latest) stable release
       - 'master' is for things included in the next upcoming release
       - 'next' contains topics for some future release after the next
         one
	 - things we want to eventually include but not as part of the
           next release
       - 'pu' is pending updates
	 - experimental stuff that may be included or dumped or
            rewritten

     Merging does
       - master into maint, maint advances and records a new release tag
       - master merges cooked topics ready for the next release
       - next merges cooked topics for a following release
       - pu merges experimental stuff and is normally rebased
	 - this allows topics to be dropped, rewritten, or graduate to a 
	   branch that only merges to advance (master, maint, or next)
